The Donation app is a web application designed to track and manage donations made by its members over the years. It is a Sass project. It offers features that allow members to log their monetary contributions and provides a blog page that caters to users with roles ranging from guests to administrators.

This app distinguishes between three user roles: Guests, Members, and Administrators. Members and Administrators have access to the Members page. However, Administrators hold additional privileges, including the ability to add, delete, and update both members and blog posts.

The app is built using several technologies, including Next.js, AppRouter, Clerk, Zustand, Tailwind CSS, Prisma, and ShadcnUi.
